Intermediate Sorting Algorithm
3 more to cover

They are much faster but also a little bit more challenging
They're less intuitive to write on your own

They're meatier, juicier algorithms that take more time to understand
but the payoff is that they are much more faster

Objectives
- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far.
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

Why learn this?
- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well.
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

Compared to bubble sorting an array of 100000 elements, it takes about 2 seconds to run
While, merge sort finishes running almost immediately

Faster Sorts
- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
