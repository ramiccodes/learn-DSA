Data Structures

What do they do?
- Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them,
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

Why so many?
- Different data structures excel at different things.
Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays)
are more generally used.

Why care?
- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need
to use one of these data structures
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly different
- And of course... INTERVIEWS

There is no BEST one data structure

They all excel in different situations. Otherwise, why bother learning them all?

For example, you're working with a map/location data that will route you to the nearest gas station:
You might want to use a graph

What if you need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?
You might want to use a linked list

Web scraping nested HTML?
Use a tree!
